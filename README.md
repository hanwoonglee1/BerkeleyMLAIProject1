For independent analysis, I focused on the drivers who received coupons to more expensive (or "fine dining" as I call them) restaurants
Those who are more likely to accept coupons for fine dining restaurants are more likely:
- Driving with a partner
- In a nicer weather
- In a warmer temperature
- Responding to 1d coupons, more than 2h coupons
- In relationships with unmarried/married partners
- Without children
- Less educational attainment
- Visiting bars, cheap restaurants, and fine dining restaurants more frequently

I also explored the cross-correlation among select variables, and the key findings are:
- Weather and temperature are highly correlated
- People who dine at fine dining restaurants are also dining at cheap restaurants
- People who dine at fine dining restaurants are also visiting bars frequently
- Having longer expiration time and prior visit history to fine dining are most correlated with coupon acceptance
- Among the filtered set of columns that showed interesting 1st order patterns, having children and education are least correlated with coupon acceptance

The last section of my analysis dives deeper into specific questions, such as:

1. What % of drivers received 2h coupons more than 2 hours before typical dinner or lunch time (12pm, 6pm) or afterwards? Did this impact their acceptance rates?
   - 536 out of 1,492 drivers received 2h coupons. As we saw above, these are less effective in driving acceptance than 1d coupons
   - Unsurprisingly, if they received 2h coupons early morning (7am) or late night (10pm), they are unlikely to accept these coupons given the 2-hour window does not overlap with either lunch or dinner time
   - It is also worth noting that coupons that arrived slightly BEFORE meal times (e.g. 10am, 2pm) yielded higher acceptance rates than those arrived AT meal times (e.g. 6pm).
   - Hence, the business takeaway should be that 2h coupons should target customers before lunch and dinner times
2. Of the drivers who received coupons at 10am and 2pm (the best times for 2h coupons as shown above), did 2h coupons result in higher acceptance rates?
   - Even for the drivers that received coupons at 10am and 2pm--the prime times for 2h coupons--1d coupons resulted in a higher acceptance rate
   - Hence, we can hypothesize that 1d coupons are in almost all cases more effective than 2h coupons
3. Are drivers with their partners in the passenger seats that have no children more likely to accept fine dining coupons than those who do?
   - As expected, those driving with their partners with no children are more likely to accept coupons than those who do, given they likely have mealtime commitments
4. Does this pattern for those driving with their partners that have no children hold true for Carry out & Take away coupons
   - Interestingly, it turns out that there is a more effective coupon for those driving with partners who have children.
   - The convenience of carry outs & take aways appeal strongly to these parents, who show a higher acceptance rate than those driving with partners who have no children
   - From business perspective, we should weigh the ROI of providing finedining coupons (likely higher margin with lower acceptance rate) against carry out & take away coupons (likely lower margin with higher acceptance rate)
